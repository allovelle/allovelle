- 👋 Hi, I’m @allovelle
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her OR they/them, do NOT call me sir.
- 👀 I’m interested in compilers, interpreters, virtual machines, language
    design, operating systems, graphics libraries, and automation tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Rust 🦀 and Zig ⚡️.
- 🩷 Fun fact: I've been coding since I was 17 years old and I still love it!
